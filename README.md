## FAQ

I have not been employed in the software industry yet. I am currently attending college while I finish my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In the meantime, I enjoy programming for fun.

### What programming languages do you use?

I mainly use C and C++, but I have worked with so many other languages in the past that I have lost track. The list includes Python, C#, and Java.

### What tools do you use for software development?

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for code editing. I also use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for generating my C and C++ projects. I like to use the [REUSE Specification](https://reuse.software/) in all of my open source projects to document licenses.

### What operating system do you use?

I use [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/) with [Gnome Desktop](https://www.gnome.org/).
